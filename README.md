An on the fly YouTube playlist generator that fetches links from a thread. Major features:

- Plays videos one after the other, one page after the other when there's +200 links
- Integrated with 4chanX meaning new links are added to the playlist as thread progresses
- Sanity check on each link meaning that only playable videos will end up in the playlist
- Dedicated draggable dialog a la 4chan X featuring tabs shortcut, jump-to and close buttons 
- Remembers position inside the playlist and dialog coordinates even on browser and PC reboot
- Dedicated support for Warosu (it's truly a YouTube links goldmine!)
